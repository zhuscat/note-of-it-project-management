# What is Project Scope Management

Collecting requirements involves defining and documenting the features and functions of the products for the project as well as the processes used for creating them. The project team creates requirements documentation and a requirements traceability matrix as outputs of the requirements collection process.

Defining scope involves reviewing the scope management plan, project charter, requirements documents, and organizational process assets to create a scope statement, adding more information as requirements are developed and change requests are approved.

Validating scope involves formalizing acceptance of the project deliverables. Key project stakeholders, such as the customer and sponsor for the project, inspect and then formally accept the deliverables during this process.

The requirements management plan documents how project requirements will be analyzed, documented, and managed.

# Planning Scope Management

a subsidiary part of the project management plan

Creating the WBS is a subprocess associated with the planning process of the project scope management.

# Collecting Requirements

A requirements traceability matrix (RTM) is a table that lists requirements, their various attributes, and the status of the requirements to ensure that all are addressed.

# Defining Scope

**Project scope statements** should include at **least** a **product scope description**, **product user acceptance criteria**, and **detailed information on all project deliverables**.

The charter describes the high-level scope, time and cost goals for the project objectives and successs criteria, a general approach to accomplishing the project's goals, and the mian roles and responsibilities of important project stakeholders.

Many information technology projects also require detailed functional and design specifications for developing software, which also should be referenced in the detailed scope statement.

The project scope statement should reference supporting documents, such as product specifications that will affect what products are produced or purchased, or corporate policies, which might affect how products or services are produced.

The main outputs of scope definition are the project scope statement and project document updates.

WBS字典

A work breakdown structure (WBS) is a deliverable oriented grouping of the work involved in a project that defines its total scope.

The project scope management plan, scope statement, requirements documentation, enterprise environmental factors, and organizational process assets are the primary inputs for creating a WBS.

The scope baseline includes the approved project scope statement and its associated WBS and WBS dictionary.

A work package is a task at the lowest level of the WBS. It represents the level of work that the project manager monitors and controls.

The scope statement should list and describe all of the deliverables required for the project.

The scope baseline includes the approved project scope statement and its associated WBS and WBS dictionary.

**Tasks in a WBS that are decomposed into smaller tasks are called summary task**

PMI uses the term *task* to describe each leel of work in the WBS.

Some organizations prescribe the form and content of WBSs for particular projects. These are known as **guidelines**.

An **WBS Dictionary** is a document that describes detailed information about each WBS item.

# Validate Scope

scope verification 是指整个项目可交付成果的正式验收

Scope creep refers to the tendency for project scope to keep getting bigger and bigger.

The main tool for performing scope validation is **inspection** and group decision making techniques.

# Controlling Scope

主要工具是实施偏差分析

**Variance** is the difference between planned and actual performance.

**Prototyping** involves developing a working replica of the system or some aspect of the system.

**Use case modeling** is a process for identifying and modeling business events, who initiated them, and how the system should respond to them.

Joint Application Design (JAD) uses highly organized and intensive workshops to bring together project stakeholders — the sponsor, users, business analysts, programmers, and so on —to jointly define and design information systems.

**What is a work breakdown structure? What are the inputs and tools used for creating one?**


A work breakdown structure (WBS) is a deliverable-oriented grouping of the work involved in a project that defines the total scope of the project. Because most projects involve many people and many different deliverables, it is important to organize and divide the work into logical parts based on how the work will be performed. The WBS is a foundation document in project management because it provides the basis for planning and managing project schedules, costs, resources, and changes. Since the WBS defines the total scope of the project, some project management experts believe that work should not be done on a project if it is not included in the WBS. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a good WBS.

The project scope statement, stakeholder requirements documentation, and organizational process assets are the primary inputs for creating a WBS. The main tool or technique is decomposition, that is, subdividing project deliverables into smaller pieces. The outputs of the process of creating the WBS are the WBS itself, the WBS dictionary, a scope baseline, and project document updates.



**List and briefly describe five approaches for creating work breakdown structures.**


Using Guidelines
If guidelines for developing a WBS exist, it is very important to follow them. Some organizations—the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) for example—prescribe the form and content for WBSs for particular projects. 

Many organizations provide guidelines and templates for developing WBSs, as well as examples of WBSs from past projects. At the request of many of its members, the Project Management Institute recently developed a WBS Practice Standard to provide guidance for developing and applying the WBS to project management. 

Project managers and their teams should review appropriate information to develop their unique project WBSs more efficiently.

The Analogy Approach
In the analogy approach, you use a similar project’s WBS as a starting point. Some organizations keep a repository of WBSs and other project documentation on file to assist people working on projects. Viewing examples of other similar projects’ WBSs allows you to understand different ways to create a WBS.

The Top-down and Bottom-up Approaches
Most project managers consider the top-down approach of WBS construction to be conventional. To use the top-down approach, start with the largest items of the project and break them into their subordinate items. This process involves refining the work into greater and greater levels of detail. After finishing the process, all resources should be assigned at the work package level. The top-down approach is best suited to project managers who have vast technical insight and a big-picture perspective.

In the bottom-up approach, team members first identify as many specific tasks related to the project as possible. They then aggregate the specific tasks and organize them into summary activities, or higher levels in the WBS. The bottom-up approach can be very time-consuming, but it can also be a very effective way to create a WBS. Project managers often use the bottom-up approach for projects that represent entirely new systems or approaches to doing a job, or to help create buy-in and synergy with a project team.

Mind Mapping
Mind mapping is a technique that uses branches radiating out from a core idea to structure thoughts and ideas. Instead of writing tasks down in a list or immediately trying to create a structure for tasks, mind mapping allows people to write and even draw pictures of ideas in a nonlinear format. This more visual, less structured approach to defining and then grouping tasks can unlock creativity among individuals and increase participation and morale among teams.

After discovering WBS items and structure using the mind-mapping technique, you could then translate the information into chart or tabular form. Mind mapping can be used for developing WBSs using the top-down or bottom-up approach.


**Describe the process of scope verification.**


Scope verification involves formal acceptance of the completed project scope by the stakeholders. This acceptance is often achieved by a customer inspection and then sign-off on key deliverables. To receive formal acceptance of the project scope, the project team must develop clear documentation of the project’s products and procedures to evaluate if they were completed correctly and satisfactorily. To minimize scope changes, it is crucial to do a good job of verifying project scope.

The scope management plan, scope baseline, requirements documentation, requirements traceability matrix, validated deliverables, and work performance data are the main inputs for scope validation. The main tools for performing scope validation are inspection and group decision-making techniques. The customer, sponsor, or user inspects the work after it is delivered and decides if it meets requirements. The main outputs of scope validation are accepted deliverables, change requests, work performance information, and project documents updates.


**What are some of the suggestions for improving the requirements process?**


1. Develop and follow a requirements management process that includes procedures for initial requirements determination.

2. Employ techniques such as prototyping, use case modeling, and Joint Application Design to understand user requirements thoroughly. Prototyping involves developing a working replica of the system or some aspect of the system. These working replicas may be throwaways or an incremental component of the deliverable system. Prototyping is an effective tool for gaining an understanding of requirements, determining the feasibility of requirements, and resolving user interface uncertainties. Use case modeling is a process for identifying and modeling business events, who initiated them, and how the system should respond to them. It is an effective tool for understanding requirements for information systems. Joint Application Design (JAD) uses highly organized and intensive workshops to bring together project stakeholders—the sponsor, users, business analysts, programmers, and so on—to jointly define and design information systems. These techniques also help users become more active in defining system requirements. 

3. Put all requirements in writing and keep them current and readily available. Several tools are available to automate this function. For example, a type of software called a requirements management tool aids in capturing and maintaining requirements information, provides immediate access to the information, and assists in establishing necessary relationships between requirements and information created by other tools.

4. Create a requirements management database for documenting and controlling requirements. Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools or other technologies can assist in maintaining a repository for project data. A CASE tool’s database can also be used to document and control requirements.

5. Provide adequate testing to verify that the project’s products perform as expected. Conduct testing throughout the project life cycle.  

6. Use a process for reviewing requested requirements changes from a systems perspective. 

7. Emphasize completion dates.

8. Allocate resources specifically for handling change requests.
