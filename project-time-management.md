# Milestones

- A milestone is a significant event that normally has no duration.
- It often takes several activities and a lot of work to complete a milestone.

Milestones should be

- Specific
- Measurable
- Assignable
- Realistic
- Time-framed

# Denpendencies

- Mandatory dependencies
- Discretionary dependencies
- External dependencies

Task Dependency Types

![Task Dependency Types](/assets/屏幕截图 2016-12-20 12.55.18.png)

**Duration** includes the actual amount of time worked on an activity plus elapsed time.

**Effort** is the number of workdays or work hours required to complete a task

Duration 和 Effort 的区别？

Critical Path Method(CPM)

**Slack** or **float** is the amount of tiem an activity may be delayed without delaying a succeeding activity or the project finish date

浮动时间的计算

活动最迟开始时间 - 活动最早开始时间（LS-ES)

活动最迟结束时间 - 活动最早结束时间 （LF-EF）

## Using the Critical Path to Shorten a Project Schedule

- Shortening durations of critical activities/tasks by addingmore resources or changing their scope
- Crashing activities by obtaining the greatest amount of schedule compression for the least incremental cost
- Fast tracking activities by doing them in parallel or overlapping them

## Critical Chain Scheduling

## PERT

**probabilistic time estimates**

PERT weighted average = (optimistic time + 4 * most likely time + pessimistic time) / 6
