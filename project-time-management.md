# Plan schedule management

# Define activities

## Milestones

* A milestone is a significant event that normally has no duration.
* It often takes several activities and a lot of work to complete a milestone.

Milestones should be

* Specific
* Measurable
* Assignable
* Realistic
* Time-framed

# Sequence activities

## Dependencies

* Mandatory dependencies
* Discretionary dependencies
* External dependencies

## Network Diagrams

can only show finish-to-start dependencies

# Estimate activity resources

# Estimate activity durations

**Duration** includes the actual amount of time worked on an activity plus elapsed time.

**Effort** is the number of workdays or work hours required to complete a task

Duration 和 Effort 的区别？

不要把工期人工量混淆，后者是完成任务所需要的工作天数或者工作小时数

* 关键路径分析
* 关键链进度法
* PERT分析

Critical Path Method\(CPM\)

**Slack** or **float** is the amount of time an activity may be delayed without delaying a succeeding activity or the project finish date

浮动时间的计算

活动最迟开始时间 - 活动最早开始时间（LS-ES\)

活动最迟结束时间 - 活动最早结束时间 （LF-EF）

# Control schedule

## Using the Critical Path to Shorten a Project Schedule

* Shortening durations of critical activities/tasks by adding
  more resources or changing their scope
* Crashing activities by obtaining the greatest amount of schedule compression for the least incremental cost
* Fast tracking activities by doing them in parallel or overlapping them

## Critical Chain Scheduling

## PERT

**probabilistic time estimates**

PERT weighted average = \(optimistic time + 4 \* most likely time + pessimistic time\) / 6
